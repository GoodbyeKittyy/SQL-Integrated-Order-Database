 ## Description

This project was created using Microsoft Access and integrated with SQL. 

Built on SQL technology, the database is scalable and helps users maintain a centralized repository of staff leave data, including leave balances, types of leave, and historical leave records. The application takes care of different modules and their associated reports, which are produced as per the applicable strategies and standards that are put forwarded by the administrative staff. The entire project has been developed keeping in view of the distributed client server computing technology, in mind.
