 ## Description

This project was created using Microsoft Access and integrated with SQL. 

The Order Database is essential for maintaining accurate and up-to-date information about orders and inventory. It enables retailers to efficiently process orders and ensure timely delivery to customers.

Built on SQL technology, the database is scalable and can integrated with other systems to monitor product availability, stock levels, and replenishment needs in real-time. Furthermore, the database can be further developed to generate reports and analytics on order metrics, including sales performance, order trends, customer behavior, and inventory turnover. These insights inform strategic decision-making, sales forecasting, and inventory planning efforts.
